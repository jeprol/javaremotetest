I have completed the java remote coding exercise within 8hours.

Based on the problem given, I had come out with complete program which cater scenario below:
1. Normal equation without brackets
2. Equation with brackets
3. Equation with nested brackets.
4. Priority calculation of division and multiplication.

The assumption would be the String parameter are consisting of numbers, operators and brackets separated by spaces.

Summary of my program:

1. Split the string parameter by spaces into an arrays.
2. Find the brackets pairs and store into the maps.
3. Sort the maps keys to process the brackets pairs correctly.
4. Calculate the equation.
5. Print out the result.
